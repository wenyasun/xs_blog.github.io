title: Deep Coevolutionary Network: Embedding User and Item Features for Recommendation
---
Before reading the paper, I have following questions:
- what recommendation does this paper make?
- How does it learn user and item embedding?
- what's the novelty in this paper?

Findings in the paper:
- user embedding: behaviors of user
- item embedding: properties of item
- user and item embeddings co-evolve over time

Existing research:
- point process based method: make parametric assumptions about evolution process
- this paper: deep co-evolve, learn user and item embedding based on interaction graph
- key idea of this paper: use RNN over evolving networks to define density function used in point based process

Background knowledge:
- temporal point process: conditional intensity function(intensity function dependent on t)
- for example, poisson process has a constant intensity over t, which is the mean of event times. 
- 事件在t时刻发生的概率: 0
- 事件在[0,t]时刻发生的概率: [0-t]积分
- 事件在[0,t]不发生的概率: 1-[0-t]的积分

## Predicting Dynamic Embedding Trajectory in Temporal Interaction Networks
evaluation metric used for predicting next interaction of user: 
- mean reciprocal rank - sum(1/rank of real value)
- ROC curve and AUC in classification: 
- Area under curve: a standard metric in the tasks with highly imbalanced labels.

Node embeddings: 
- static embedding by one-hot vector
- dynamic embedding

Work needs to be done:
- 修改bipartite graph为non bipartite graph where items  are connected to each other
- 修改task-based loss function
- build dataset

### 我都改了什么? 
- 拉普拉斯函数, 从+变成了-号
- 构建了mtr数据集, 包括user, item, timestamp, event_type
- 𝑡𝑏𝑝𝑡𝑡_𝑙𝑒𝑛 从20改到了2或者1, 原因是地铁网络需要实时更新来确保预测准确度
- 将recall@10 改成了 recall@1, 因为如果预测车辆到达非相邻station没有意义
- 修改了adjacency matrix使相邻item(station)相连
- 降低学习率到更低数量级
  
### 还需要修改什么? 
- 数据集上可能需要添加更多feat, 还有remaining journey time column
- 检查代码 尤其是data_loader, 看在mtr数据集上是否make sense
- 修改batch部分代码, 使每天的数据为一个batch
- 添加pred_loss, 修改prediction task为remaining journey time
- 关于更新之后把边删掉的问题, 如何相应的修改邻接矩阵?
### 我遇到的问题? 
- 拉普拉斯矩阵到底需不需要改?
- 我应该怎么使用batch来训练
- 验证时也需要根据前面的数据来更新embedding
### event streams modelling
- Possion Process: which assumes that events occur indepently of one another
- non-homogenous Poisson process: probablity vary with time t, but it is still independent of other events
- A Hawkes process: supposes that past events can temporarily raise
the probability of future events: assuming that such excitation is ①positive, ② additive over the past events, and ③ exponentially decaying with time

- 更新之后删除边 
- initial embedding should include the static features of users and items, can change it to one-hot embedding, 可以不用这个嘛
