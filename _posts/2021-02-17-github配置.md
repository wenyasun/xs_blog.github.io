title: Adding ssh key to github account
---
When you have a new machine, you probably want to set up git and connect with your github account, this blog will help you to do so. 
- Generating public/private ed25519 key pair:<br>
 ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email_address"
- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
- copy your public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

go to github setting/SSH key, add your public key there!
